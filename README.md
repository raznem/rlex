# RL exercises

Before you start install requirements with `pip isntall -r requirements.txt`

## Part 1. A2C
1. Finish A2C implementation in the `rltoolkit/algorithms/a2c.py`, comment in the code will explain all details. You can test your code by running file from the terminal.
2. Do some experiments in the notebook `notebooks/01-A2C.ipynb`, there you will use your implementation to explore impact of hyperparameters on performance.

## Part 2. PPO
1. Finish PPO implementation in the `rltoolkit/algorithms/ppo.py`, details are in the script file. 

## Part 3. DDPG
Stay tuned.
